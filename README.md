# SunEasy

## Summary
I'm currently developing a full-stack project that serves as a comprehensive catalog for Solar Panels and Inverters. To achieve high scalability and maintain a robust architecture, we have chosen to leverage **Spring Boot** to implement a microservices approach.

The project is designed with horizontal scalability in mind, and for that purpose, I am utilizing Nginx as both a Reverse Proxy and a Load Balancer. Additionally, I have incorporated Redis for caching, enhancing the overall performance and responsiveness of our application.
